This is the first every minecraft mod that I made for
as a school project. I plan to continue and develop more
mods as time goes on and I hope that this can prove to be
enjoyable for others to play on. The purpose of this mod
is to expand the playability of Minecraft following the
defeat of the Ender Dragon. While many people may love
to build farms and make gigantic machineries in the world,
I am incapable of finding joy in that. Sp I sincerely wish
that this mod can bring more joy for people into the world
of Minecraft, even if it's just a temporary goal.
